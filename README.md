# Practical Works – Variational and Bayesian Methods & Discrete Optimization

This repository gathers four practical works (PWs) completed as part of the course on **variational and Bayesian methods with applications to image analysis and optimization** at Telecom Paris. Each practical session explores a different aspect of Markovian modeling, Bayesian inference and graph-cut optimization in image processing.

## Contents

### PW1 – Markovian Models
Implementation of a Gibbs sampler for binary Markov random fields. The objective is to explore the influence of the regularization parameter on sampling and to generate realizations of Markovian models.

### PW2 – Bayesian Analysis with MRF
Application of Markov random fields (MRFs) for Bayesian classification of grayscale images. The session focuses on binary classification, reconstruction from noisy observations, and evaluation of results using ground truth.

### PW3 – Graph-cut Optimization (Binary Case)
Use of graph-cut optimization for binary segmentation tasks. The lab compares this approach with ICM and simulated annealing, and applies it to both object/background segmentation and textured image segmentation using conditional random fields.

### PW4 – Graph-cut Optimization (Multilevel Case)
Extension of graph-cut methods to multi-label problems with **α-expansion** and **α-β swap** algorithms. The work applies these techniques to grayscale image denoising under Gaussian and Rayleigh noise models, comparing different regularization potentials.
